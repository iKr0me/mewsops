# MewsOps HTTP contract v1

Use opaque IDs, UTC timestamps, same-origin requests and a session cookie. JSON responses use `{"data":...}`. Errors use `{"error":{"code":"VALIDATION","message":"Malformed request","requestId":"..."}}`. Responses include X-Request-Id and Cache-Control: no-store. Only a successful private media download returns binary data.

## Synthetic frontend examples

Start a volunteer session with `{"persona":"volunteer"}`. Submit this JSON to /api/reports:

```json
{
  "clientRequestId": "demo-phone-1",
  "selectedColonyId": "colony-1",
  "text": "Cat limping beside the fictional gate.",
  "mediaIds": []
}
```

For photos, upload first and include the returned IDs. Staff can retrieve the full sanitized PNG. If it exceeds the agent's size limit, analysis uses a reduced PNG with the same evidence ID. A cat suggestion requires both a submitted photo citation and a vetted description for that candidate. Optional report fields are demoLocationId and observedAt. The original report text and immediate unverified alert survive processing failures. Switch to the staff persona in a separate browser profile, list reports, then POST the process command for the returned ID. The default fixture leaves cat identity unresolved. When the agent supplies a candidate and the backend creates a review, a staff decision looks like:

```json
{
  "decision": "approve",
  "expectedVersion": 1,
  "reason": "Compared both synthetic observations",
  "selectedCatId": "cat-1"
}
```

selectedCatId is the existing backend's optional extension for choosing among frozen candidates. On 409 refresh the review before acting. Other statuses: 400 malformed input, 401 missing/expired session, 403 insufficient scope, 404 missing resource, 503 unavailable media/analyzer or rejected agent output. Report submission and processing are separate commands. While the first analysis runs, polling can continue to show received; on failure poll the saved report for failed status. Staff can inspect the original report and alert even when no proposal exists.
